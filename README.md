Momos Token Changer is a Module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop which allows the Game Master and Players to change the token art of Actors on the go. The Module adds a button to the Token HUD which allows the player to change the image displayed on their token at any time.

The module is based off [FVTT-TokenHUBWildcard](https://github.com/javieros105/FVTT-TokenHUDWildcard) - re-written to work with Foundry V10.
